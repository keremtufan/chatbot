# Chatbot Repository

This repository contains small demo applications including a simple
command-line Sudoku solver (`sudoku.py`) and a small web application.

## Sudoku Web App

The web version is located in the `public` folder and can be served with
`server.js`. Launch it from VS Code or run:

```bash
node server.js
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser to use the solver.
